abstract = {The role of positron emission tomography (PET) during the past decade has evolved rapidly from a pure research tool to a methodology of enormous clinical potential. Perhaps the most striking development is the use of PET in oncology. PET imaging is approved in the United States for lung, lymphoma, colon, and melanoma cancer imaging. Data are accumulating rapidly to attest the efficacy of Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging in a wide variety of malignant tumors with sensitivities and specificities often in the high 90s. FDG uptake has been shown in tumors of the head and neck, ovary, breast, musculoskeletal system, and neuroendocrine system as well. The major role of PET has emerged as a reliable method for evaluating and staging recurrent disease. But it also has an important role in differentiating beningn and malignant primary tumors. This has been shown particularly well in the differential diagnosis of solitary lung nodules. Although FDG has emerged as the dominant radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging in oncology, numerous other compounds are being evaluated. It is likely that more specific and efficacious compounds will be introduced during the next decade. F-18, because of its highly favorable physical characteristics, is likely to become the technetium of PET imaging. The next decade will witness an explosive growth of PET technology in oncologic imaging.}

abstract = {Purpose
Radiomics describes the extraction of multiple, otherwise invisible, features from medical images that, with bioinformatic approaches, can be used to provide additional information that can predict underlying tumor biology and behavior.
Methods and Materials
Radiomic signatures can be used alone or with other patient-specific data to improve tumor phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and prognosis, noninvasively. The data describing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography radiomics, often using texture or heterogeneity parameters, are increasing rapidly.
Results
In relation to radiation therapy practice, early data have reported the use of radiomic approaches to better define tumor volumes and predict radiation toxicity and treatment response.
Conclusions
Although at an early stage of development, with many technical challenges remaining and a need for standardization, promise nevertheless exists that PET radiomics will contribute to personalized medicine, especially with the availability of increased computing power and the development of machine-learning approaches for imaging.}
